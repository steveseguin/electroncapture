# Window-Specific Audio Capture Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The goal is to capture audio from a specific Windows application WITHOUT mixing in other system audio. When capturing from Windows Media Player, we should NOT hear Spotify or other applications.

## Current Status

### What We've Tried

1. **Process-Specific Loopback (VIRTUAL_AUDIO_DEVICE_PROCESS_LOOPBACK)**
   - Status: Fails with E_OUTOFMEMORY (0x8000000e)
   - Issue: Windows Media Player and many apps don't support this API
   - Requires: Windows 10 2004+ or Windows 11
   - Problem: Even with correct structures and admin rights, many applications fail

2. **Session-Based Capture**
   - Status: Works but captures ALL system audio
   - Issue: Cannot isolate specific application audio
   - Result: User hears Spotify mixed with target app

3. **Research Findings**
   - OBS win-capture-audio plugin faces same issues
   - They use "one-shot helper processes" with shared memory
   - Process-specific API cannot be re-initialized after first use
   - Many applications don't support the new Windows audio APIs

## Viable Solutions

### 1. Helper Process Approach (Like OBS)
- Create separate helper processes for each capture
- Use shared memory for audio data transfer
- Avoids re-initialization issues
- Still limited by app compatibility

### 2. Virtual Audio Cable Approach
- Create virtual audio device
- Route specific app audio to virtual device
- Capture from virtual device
- Requires driver installation

### 3. Audio Hook Injection
- Inject DLL into target process
- Hook audio APIs directly
- Most reliable but complex
- May trigger anti-cheat systems

### 4. Session Monitoring with Filtering
- Capture all audio but only when target app is active
- Monitor audio session states
- Filter based on timing
- Not perfect isolation but better than nothing

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Short Term**: Implement session-based capture with clear warnings about limitations
2. **Medium Term**: Implement helper process approach for apps that support it
3. **Long Term**: Consider virtual audio driver or hook-based solution

## Current Implementation
The session-based approach is implemented and working. It:
- Captures system audio when target app has an active session
- Monitors session state changes
- Provides clear warnings about mixed audio
- Works with all applications

## Known Limitations
1. Cannot truly isolate single application audio with current Windows APIs
2. Process-specific capture only works with certain modern applications
3. Full isolation requires driver-level or injection-based solutions
